The File looks a little strange in a Repository. It is the origin of a video-tutorial from 1984:

I did have this video on VHS-Cassette and the program developed there was my first step in learning
programming. The .bas file can be used by cbmbasic as script

Later when I changed to Amiga and a new Programming Language C a new Version with the old Feeling of the
old C64 was born:

Later when I learned Python I found the old Video at Youtube and build the program in Python, too.

Now I have also a Web-version:
